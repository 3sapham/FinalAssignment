                <p> The industrial revolution brought significant changes to social conditions <a
                        href="#first">(Schrumpf, 2021)</a>.
                    Perhaps the most important change was the workplace. Before the
                    industrial revolution, the vast majority of production was done by individual people or
                    groups of people who worked together <a href="#first">(Schrumpf, 2021)</a>. But with the rise of
                    cities, people
                    moved from the countryside to work in
                    factories. This made it possible
                    to mass produce on a large scale and increased efficiency. In our time, automation
                    can be likened to the industrial revolution, and like the industrial revolution,
                    automation can bring big changes to social conditions.
                </p>
                <p> The development of automation can be connected to changes in societal values. The
                    work-life balance is an important societal value whose change perhaps started long
                    before the advent of automation <a href="#second"> (Gisle,
                        2021)</a>. Long working hours was a big
                    social problem. Today we have laws that limit how many hours we can work in a
                    week. Even then, if repetitive work can be automated, workers can have more time
                    in their private lives, increase production and focus on more important tasks <a href="#third">
                        (Harris, 2019)</a> <a href="#fourth">
                        (Groover, 2020)</a>. It can also lead to happier workers. An everyday
                    example is self-service cashiers that have optimized and relieved workload. It has
                    allowed for shorter queues, better capacity and gives more focus on customers and
                    other tasks. Some stores hire fewer employees and instead hire higher-educated
                    workers related to the newer technology. There are concerns such as the possibility that workers
                    will become
                    slaves to the machines and that our privacy will be endangered by the computers and data
                    collections. Especially since automation requires large amounts of information
                    collected from our everyday lives.
                </p>
                <p> On the whole, automation, if used correctly, can bring great opportunities in the
                    future. It may keep workers away from tasks that are repetitive, hazardous and may
                    even provide greater environments socially and economically, thus letting people
                    enjoy their lives and time more than ever.
