            <h2>Automation</h2>
            <p> The industrial revolution brought significant changes to social conditions 
                <a href="#first">(Schrumpf et al., 2021)</a>. Perhaps the most important change was the 
                workplace. Before the industrial revolution, the vast majority of production was done by 
                individual people or groups of people who worked together <a href="#first">(Schrumpf et al., 2021)</a>. 
                But with the rise of cities, people moved from the countryside to work in factories. 
                This made it possible to mass produce on a large scale and increased efficiency. 
                In our time, automation can be likened to the industrial revolution, and like the 
                industrial revolution, automation can bring big changes to social conditions.
            </p>
            <p> The development of automation can be connected to changes in societal values. The
                work-life balance is an important societal value whose change perhaps started long
                before the advent of automation <a href="#second"> (Gisle et al., 2021)</a>. Long 
                working hours was a big social problem. Today we have laws that limit how many hours 
                we can work in a week. Even then, if repetitive work can be automated, workers can have 
                more time in their private lives, increase production and focus on more important tasks 
                <a href="#third">(Harris, 2019)</a> <a href="#fourth">(Groover, 2020)</a>. It can also 
                lead to happier workers. An everyday example is self-service cashiers that have optimized 
                and relieved workload. It has allowed for shorter queues, better capacity and gives more 
                focus on customers and other tasks. Some stores hire fewer employees and instead hire 
                higher-educated workers related to the newer technology.
            </p> 
            <p>There are concerns such as the possibility that workers will become
                slaves to the machines and that our privacy will be endangered by the computers and data
                collections. Especially since automation requires large amounts of information
                collected from our everyday lives.
            </p>
            <p> On the whole, automation, if used correctly, can bring great opportunities in the
                future. It may keep workers away from tasks that are repetitive, hazardous and may
                even provide greater environments socially and economically, thus letting people
                enjoy their lives and time more than ever.
